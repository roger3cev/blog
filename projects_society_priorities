<p>I'm a little bit tired right now, so forgive me if my writing is a little hazy.

<p>I have a lot of different interests: skateboarding, harmonica, video games, media... and programming.


<p>Now, let's just look at programming:
I have over 10 projects on github, 3 of which I have worked on consistently over extended periods of time.
A few more I have ongoing plans for but haven't worked on as regularly.  That makes for about 5 or 6 active projects.

<p>Overtime, I think my project ideas have gotten better. They have more specific focus, more achievable goals, more immediate usability.
But still I struggle.  The challenge now is priorities.

<p>Nothing we do is in a vacuum.  Without feedback and support for projects, it can be hard to perserve and deliver,
unless you are really into an idea.  Our social context for programming is just as important as our low level competency
and our high level creative abstractions.

<p>Let's look at my primary active projects: amoeba-sketch, turnbased-data, trust-ledger, htmlsandbox, list2markupjs, and JSDataType.

<p> My drawing program I find interesting, but there's a lot of choices in that space.  The best option would involve getting a high
quality tablet.  My program is a creative workaround.  As for where it's at, it has enough implemented to be functional and usable,
but not enough to be efficient and effortless.

<p> turnbased-data is really cool.  I like the way I designed it and I see a lot of potential there.

<p>htmlsandbox is a fun tool for doing coding experiments and facilitating a very lightweight scripting development environment.

<p>list2markupjs and JSDataType are programming tools, I already use them in these other projects. I may deploy them as npm modules
when I wrinkle out the details.

<p>trust-ledger has good ideas.

<p> None of these projects deserve the top spot on my priority list.

<p>I'm gonna stop using github for everything, focus on it as a publishing tool for projects that really merit public development.
I'll probably delete a few dead-end projects(not the active ones or historical ones).

<p>I've been getting into bug tracking, reading so much Joel, which has made me dig up the good ol' "fossil" dvcs.

<p> Night. Peace out peeps.

<p> The moral of the story is, I'm not that invested in any of these right now, and want to give myself cognitive space to find better priorities.
