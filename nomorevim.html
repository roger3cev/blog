		Why I stopped using vim</a>

	<p>
		I've stopped using vim for writing code.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of you may moan that I'm discussing this in 2015.  We've had windowing systems for decades, what took me so long to find a modern gui editor?  To you sane people, I apologize.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm hoping there's at least a couple people out there, who, like me, have stuck with it, singing vim's praises <i>and</i> using it daily while the world has moved on.  (If you're an emacs guy, that's cool too).
	</p>
	<p>
		Vimmers love to point out that modern programming conveniences work in this ancient editor:  Syntax highlighting, splitscreen editing, autocompletion, following symbols, etc.  Some of them are tricky to learn or configure, but for vimmers, the raw power of their scripted tools makes it worth it.
	</p>
	<p>
		My transition was triggered by a very trivial feature: font size.
	</p>
	<p>
		For some time I've felt like I've had a roadblock in my programming.  I would do well starting a new project from scratch, but I'd hit a wall.  I didn't want to go back and keep working on my old projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		The problem, I reasoned, was that once my program had a certain amount of information, I had trouble keeping enough info in my head to make changes or add features.  Things got more spread out, and there was more code to sift through. 
	</p>
	<p>
		My initial reaction was that my code organization and abstractions weren't good enough.  This was a useful exercise.  Refactor the code, find the best abstactions, be more deliberate organizing datastructures and checking types in javascript.
	</p>
	<p>
		All very good things.  Like I said, a useful exercise.  It improved my coding skills dramatically.  These weren't new ideas for me, but I became more adept at applying them.
	</p>
	<p>
		That didn't solve my original problem.  I got to the point where I <i>needed</i> to start using a lisp variant of javascript.  Terse, clean syntax, language macros to forge the perfect syntax, and great support for succinct and powerful functional idioms.  It would solve all my problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		What went wrong? I not only felt that these tools would increase productivity, but that I <i>needed</i> them to write complex programs.  I was hitting a wall, and I just didn't understand how to get around it.  I was now an abstaction junky:  "Do you have any more of them sweet, sweet parentheses?"
	</p>
	<p>
		As it turns out, there are parentheses to spare.
	</p>
	<p>
		Simply by fitting more code on the screen in a clean readable font my roadblock fell away.  I could get a little bit <i>messy</i> and still navigate through my program easily.  It felt dirty but good at the same time.  I was digging it.
	</p>
	<p>
		As humans, our mental resources are quite limited.  If your brain is keeping track of which buffers are loaded and trying to figure out the best command to navigate efficiently, those mental resources aren't thinking about the code.
	</p>
	<p>
		I feel sort of stupid looking at the screen and clicking to switch between files, as if I'm some kind of cognitively primitive primate.  Come to think of it, that's <i>exactly</i> what I am.
	</p>
	<p>
		I stare at the the screen following the text with my index finger until I exclaim "THERE IS BUG!! I IS HAPPY".  Even when I need to scroll it takes no mental effort.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using vim I felt like a timelord ninja.  Teleporting through my code without even moving my hand across the keyboard.  Summoning complex and arcane incantations from the deep recesses of my brain to transform large blocks of text in the blink of an eye.  Reasoning through inscrutubale command sequences that would solve my problems in minimal keystrokes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm sure it made me smarter to learn vim.  But the timelord magic overheated my tiny human brain.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now I feel like my ancestors fingerpainting in the caves of lascaux.  It's relaxing.  I'm embracing my primitive primal self:  "BUG IS BAD. BUG GO SMASH!"
	</p>
