<p>
This post isn't about capitalism specifically, but any social arrangement you use to manage access to resources and work collaboratively.  Capitalism is just the arrangement that most people today are familiar with on a conscious and rhetorical level.

<p>
We think about programming as manipulating 1's and 0's, but it's just as much about organizing and coordinating humans.  Humans are central to the purpose of all human activities, at least for the time being(let's not get into any 'singularity' bs speculation, for now).

<p>
If you have any experience with software: development, choosing libraries, or even comparing 2 applications as a user, you have been exposed to the human element.  This can include words with a bad rap, like politics and bureaucracy.

<p>
There's nothing inherently wrong with either bureaucracy or politics.  But these words develop negative connotations because they often seem to interfere with our ability to get stuff done and realize our vision.

<p>
In reality it's probably our ineptitude with regards to bureaucracy and politics that leads to this stigma.  When people struggle with mathematics they say stuff like "I hate math.", or "When are we ever going to use this?"

<p>
You see the same kind of statements coming out of those struggling with the human element of creativity: "It's politics", "Red tape", and "<i>ugh, management</i>"

<p>
Just like mathematics can enrich your life and empower you to do amazing things, understanding politics and bureaucracy can make your life more fulfilling and rewarding.  You can achieve more while doing less.  It can make your work more pleasurable and more compelling.  It can allow you to create something together.

<p>
I'm definitely critical of capitalism, specifically, when it is presented as the only option and a transcendent power in the universe.  No, it's not.  It's only a social arrangement between humans.

<p>
That being said, there's definitely some things I like about capitalism, and it can be effective when used in proper contexts.  Pay no heed to those using that word to promote ideological worship and absurd society creation myths.

<p>
Capitalism is a feedback process for assigning resources to entities and applying those resources towards endeavors.  That's it.  In a sense, it is close to anarchy; it can be individualist or even voluntarist.  I think of anarchy as nothing more than a mental tool for describing power dynamics.

<p>
Anarchy is a way of viewing the world that throws aside traditional assumptions.  This can make many uncomfortable, without strict rules and mental blocks, chaos is a real possibility.  Applied properly, "anarchy" can still describe traditional expectations, but more importantly, it provides insights on the boundaries of those expectations, when rules start to change, or traditional relationships evolve.

<p>
We play capitalism like we play chess.  We follow a specific set of rules out of convention, it allows us to do cool stuff and have fun.  Anarchy is like when a child gets a chess set and then starts playing house with the pieces: there's not a wrong way or right way.  With anarchy, you could still play chess but you don't <i>have</i> to play chess.  That's the way I think about it.

<p>
What stuff I write, whether code or English, is motivated by a context.  Language itself is only meaningful with context.  You need a browser that can execute javascript, or at least a human with that mental model.

<p>
If you want to make software, relationships with both humans and things are important.  In a sense, I may be going about this backwards, seeking to improve my human relationships because I would like to see great software.  I should be trying to make great software because it improves human relationships.

<p>
Software is very political and social.  Anyone who doesn't see that is blind.  Focusing on mechanics to the exclusion of everything else can deprive you of the social and political context you need to enrich your life.  You won't have great software or great relationships.  I am working on improving this.
